# Changelog

[`sh1107`](https://crates.io/crates/sh1107) is a Rust driver for the SH1107 OLED display. It supports
[embedded-graphics](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-graphics) or raw pixel drawing modes and works
with the [embedded-hal](crates.io/crates/embedded-hal) traits for maximum portability.
